## The reason behind 
Yesterday i got my ordered press-n-peel foils! The reason why i want to try [press-n-peel](http://www.techniks.com/) foil is that i want to do my PCBs in our hackerspace with as less steps and costs as possible.
I've tried the [toner transfer method](http://www.dr-lex.be/hardware/tonertransfer.html) a few times but with lousy results. The toner seems to grip to the copper as well as to the paper, no matter what sort of paper i've tried. 
[Reichelt](http://reichelt.de) catalog pages, waxed paper, baking paper, etc. 
<!--more-->
The effort to rub the paper of while have the whole thing in sudsy water sucks as much as develop 
the PCBs photo resist in another chemical step. I know that there are a lot of people that have awsome results with the toner transfer method, but to me its to sophisticated. 


## Some facts
* I've ordered 10 sheets of foil on ebay for 14.50&euro; \+ 2&euro; shipping. 
* The sheet size is "Letter" (215,9mm x 279,4mm) and not A4 (210mm × 297mm) as ususal in europe. 
* That means a surface of 60322mm&#178;, enough for 3.77 Eurocard PCB board (160mm x 100mm).

## Look and feel
The foils are made of some kind of transparent flexible plastic foil and covered with some blue ink that seems not to grip on it very good.
