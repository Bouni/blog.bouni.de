And here we go with part 2 of my DQ860MA reverse engineering project!

<!--more-->

After i listed all parts, i desoldered them and cleaned the PCB very well.
Then i scanned the PCB from both sides to get a clear image of all the traces.

In the next step i will remove to top and bottom layer to hopefully get a clear view on the inner layers.
