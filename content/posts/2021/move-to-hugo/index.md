Once more I switched my static site generator from pelican to hugo!

I was not really statisfied by pelican and we use hugo as static site genarator for our hackerspaces website.
Through that I learned how cool hugo is and decided to switch.

Hopefully that will encourage me to put out more posts that in the recent years :smirk:
