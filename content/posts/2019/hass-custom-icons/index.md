I always wanted to have some custom icons for my [Home-Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) setup.
Unfortunately, if you set a SVG directly via URL (/local/myicon.svg) it does not change color depending on its state.
On the other hand, if you set an [MDI](https://materialdesignicons.com/) icon, the color changes.

So I looked for ways to get color changing icons and came across [Thomas Lov√©n's](https://github.com/thomasloven) [hass-fontawesome](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-fontawesome) that does exactly that for the Font-Awesome icons.

I tried to use his `generate.py` to generate a custom font file from my SVG's but it failed.
After looking into it, I change quite a bit so that the script worked for me (see [my fork](https://github.com/Bouni/hass-fontawesome/blob/master/generate.py)).

I struggled a bit getting my font to work but finally here's an example of what I got (the two bottom icons):

If you also want to create your own iconfont, here are some obstacles that made me strugle.

### 1. Make sure your SVG has just one path, the generate script will grab the first path and use that in the font file.

This is an example of a not working SVG, as you can see it contains multiple path nodes.

     id="path4166" /></svg>
```

Simply use [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for example an combine the paths using the appropriate tools.

### 2. Adjust the settings in the generator sxcript

There a 3 settings that can be adjusted in the `generate.py`.

```python
PREFFIX = "fas"
OUTFILE = "hass-fontawesome-solid.html"
SIZE = 1024
```

`PREFFIX` defines what will be the preffix you later on will use in your HA config. If you for example set it to `fas` you will define a icon in your config like `icon: fas:clone`

`OUTFILE` defines the name of the resulting html file.

`SIZE` defines the size of the iocns, let this value as it is.

Place the generator.py in the same folder as your SVG icons and run it from there: `python3 generator.py`. The resulting html will appear in the same folder.

### 3. Install the font file in the right place

Make sure you've created a `www` folder inside your Home Assistant config folder. In there, place the generated html file.

### 4. Configure the custom font file for use in your HA config

```markdown
frontend:
  extra_html_url:
    - /local/hass-custom-font.html
```

I used `cutomize_glob` to set one of my new icons for all of my heating valves like so:

```markdown
homeassistant:
  customize_glob:
    "binary_sensor.stellantrieb*":
       icon: lox:valve 
```

Restart HA after editing the config!

### 5. Make sure the cache of your browser doesn't fool you 

My firefox fooled me with its cache. Simply hit `Ctrl + Shift + Del` and make sure to delete the cache when trying to get the font working, after that refresh the browser with F5.
