I've worked with the Java based Arduino IDE for a long time now, and always thought that i miss the comfort of vim.
But for soom reason i never searched for an alternative, but yesterday i had enough of that shit piece of software!

## Ino

So i googled a bit to find an alternative and stumbled upon [ino](http://inotool.org/).
After a few test i must say that ino is exactly what i was looking for :-)
Take a look at the [quickstart](http://inotool.org/quickstart) to see how easy it is.
