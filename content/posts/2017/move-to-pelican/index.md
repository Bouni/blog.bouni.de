After a long period of silence I finally found the time to migrate my blog from [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) to [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/).
I really liked Octopress for a while but I always struggled to modify it in the way I wanted to mainly because it is written in Ruby, which I don't like much.

Pelican on the other side is written in Python which is my favourite language.

Anyway, I hope to get a little bit more frequent updates out now :-)
